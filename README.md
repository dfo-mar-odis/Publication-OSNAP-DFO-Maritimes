The data set is a collection of observations carried out under the framework of the OSNAP international program, which is designed to provide continuous records of water hydrographic properties and currents in the subpolar North Atlantic. The data are logged by moored instruments and floats. The array of moored instruments is aligned along two transects / legs. The first one extends from the Labrador coast to the southwestern tip of Greenland across the mouth of the Labrador Sea (OSNAP West). The second transect is orientated from the southeastern tip of Greenland to Scotland (OSNAP East). 

Archived in this repository is the collection of moored data from the OSNAP West, which covers the period of 2014-16. Five types of instruments were recovered from nine moorings: Microcats, Onsets, ADCPs, RCM-8 and RCM-11. The data have been quality-controlled and are stored in NetCDF data format. The nine moorings were deployed in different years at the four OSNAP sites on the Labrador shelf: K7, C1, C2 and C3. The collected data span the vertical range from 40 to 800 m. The coordinates, times and other essential metadata are stored in the attributes of the data files and the data inventory (file: [OSNAP_Running_Log.xlsx](https://github.com/dfo-mar-odis/Publication-OSNAP-DFO-Maritimes/blob/master/OSNAP_Running_Log.xlsx?raw=true)).
